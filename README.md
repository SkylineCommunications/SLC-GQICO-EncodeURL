## Installation

Make sure to save this class in the DataMiner automation module. Don't forget to compile this as a library since this is not a typical automation script. More info in the [docs](https://docs.dataminer.services/user-guide/Advanced_Modules/Automation_module/Using_CSharp/Compiling_a_CSharp_code_block_as_a_library.html).
